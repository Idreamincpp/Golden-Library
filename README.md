# Golden-Library-1.0.2
Official GitHub page for the golden library application written in c++

Hi, this is my first GUI project written in c++.
It's pretty basic tbh

It stores book information in a .txt.file, and you can find added books using the FindBook button.

It's written in C++ and the GUI is from wxWidgets.

Please read the README.txt file that comes with the app.

Enjoy!
