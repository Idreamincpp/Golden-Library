# Golden-Library
the Golden library application allows you to save an store books, and find them.

This is my first GUI project written in c++.
It's pretty basic tbh

It stores book information in a .txt.file, and you can find added books using the Find Book button.

It's written in C++ and the GUI is from wxWidgets.

Please read the README.txt file that comes with the app.

Enjoy!
